# Pydantic AI Harness

## Repository purpose

`pydantic-ai-harness` is the first-party capability library for Pydantic AI.

Pydantic AI core owns the primitive runtime: agent loop semantics, normalized
messages, model/provider/profile behavior, tool execution semantics, durable
execution primitives, and generic capability hooks.

Harness owns optional, batteries-included compositions built from those
primitives: coding-agent tools, guardrails, memory, context management, repo
tools, verification loops, skills, planning, sub-agents, and other reusable
agent behaviors.

When a change needs new core semantics, stop and propose the Pydantic AI core
change instead of reimplementing core behavior in harness.

## Vocabulary

- **Capability**: an `AbstractCapability` subclass that bundles tools, hooks, instructions, and model settings into a reusable unit. This is the core abstraction of pydantic-ai-harness.
- **Hook**: a lifecycle method on `AbstractCapability` that intercepts agent graph execution (e.g. `before_model_request`, `wrap_run`, `after_tool_execute`)
- **Toolset**: a collection of tools that a capability can provide to the agent
- **Guard**: a type of capability that validates inputs/outputs or controls tool access (e.g. `InputGuard`, `OutputGuard`)
- **Harness**: this package -- a collection of pre-made capabilities for Pydantic AI.
- **AICA**: AI Code Assistant -- the automated agent that implements issues, reviews plans, and handles PR feedback
- **Ralph loop**: the state-machine-based workflow that drives AICA through phases (TRIAGE -> GOALS -> PLAN -> CODE -> VERIFY -> REVIEW -> PUBLISH)
- **DDD+ protocol**: classification system for PR review comments (do, dismiss, discuss, waiting, done)

## AICA preflight

Before implementing or reviewing a capability change:

1. Read `agent_docs/index.md`.
2. Read the linked `agent_docs/` guide for the task.
3. Read the public Pydantic AI docs for every integration point you touch:
   - capabilities: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/capabilities/>
   - hooks: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/>
   - toolsets: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/>
   - advanced tools: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/>
   - agents: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/>
   - testing: <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/guides/testing/>
4. Inspect the installed `pydantic_ai` package source for exact hook/toolset
   signatures when needed. Do not assume a contributor's local checkout layout.
5. Use `pydantic_ai_harness.code_mode` as the exemplar for capability shape,
   docs, tests, and public exports until another capability becomes a better
   example. Capabilities live in their own top-level submodule
   `pydantic_ai_harness/<name>/` (module name = capability name; one module per
   capability or strategy) and are not re-exported from the root `__init__.py`,
   so each keeps its own optional dependencies. The `experimental` tier is
   retired; ACP is the sole remaining experimental capability (see
   `agent_docs/capability-authoring.md`, "Capability Submodules And Exports").

## Capabilities API reference

When implementing a new capability, reference these docs:

- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/capabilities/> -- main capabilities documentation, usage patterns, built-in capabilities
- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/hooks/> -- lifecycle hooks reference, hook ordering, all hook categories
- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/guides/extensibility/> -- publishing capabilities as packages, spec serialization
- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/toolsets/> -- toolset abstraction, building tools for capabilities
- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/tools-toolsets/tools-advanced/> -- tool hooks, prepare tools, tool validation
- <https://pydantic.dev/docs/ai/core-concepts/agent/> -- agent configuration, instructions, model settings
- Installed `pydantic_ai.capabilities` source -- `AbstractCapability`, hook signatures, and composition behavior
- Installed `pydantic_ai.toolsets` source -- `AbstractToolset`, `WrapperToolset`, and `ToolsetTool`

## Coding standards

- Python 3.10+ (target version for pyright and ruff)
- **pyright strict** mode -- no `Any` types, full type annotations
- **ruff**: line-length=120, single quotes, max-complexity=15
- **100% branch coverage** required (enforced by `make testcov`)
- docstrings use single backticks (markdown), not RST double backticks
- no typecasting (`as` in TypeScript, `cast()` in Python) -- use type narrowing instead
- prefer the most generic input types possible (reduce dependency chains)
- don't add comments that restate what the code does

## Writing style

Applies to docs, READMEs, docstrings, comments, commit messages, and PR text.

- No em-dashes (`—`). Use `--` for an aside or interruption, or split into two
  sentences. Em-dash-heavy prose reads as machine-generated.
- State facts, not sales copy. Cut marketing superlatives and hype ("blazingly
  fast", "battle-tested", "the single most expensive thing you can do",
  "footgun") and editorializing adjectives ("sprawling", "noisy", "silently").
- Avoid absolute claims ("never", "always", "guaranteed") unless they are
  literally true and load-bearing. Name the specific mechanism instead of the
  slogan.
- Use bold sparingly -- for the lead-in term of a list item, not to emphasize
  whole sentences.
- Document the why, the constraints, and the non-obvious. Don't restate what the
  code or signature already says.
- Prefer plain ASCII punctuation over decorative Unicode (arrows, fancy quotes)
  in prose and comments.

## Package management

- Use `uv` for all dependency operations
- Never edit `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` directly -- use `uv add`, `uv remove`
- External PRs that change dependencies are auto-closed by CI

## Commands

```bash
make format     # ruff format
make lint       # ruff check
make typecheck  # pyright strict
make test       # pytest
make testcov    # pytest with branch coverage
```

Always run `make lint && make typecheck && make test` before committing.

## File structure

The tree is discoverable by listing it; only the conventions that are not are
recorded here.

Each released capability is a self-contained package under
`pydantic_ai_harness/<capability>/` (naming and exports are covered in the
preflight above), with tests under `tests/<capability>/`. It ships **two**
hand-maintained docs that must stay in sync: the `README.md` next to the code
(GitHub/PyPI) and the `docs/<capability>.md` page (the docs site at
pydantic.dev/docs/ai/harness). The `docs/` folder is flat -- there are no
`capabilities/` or `experimental/` subdirectories. A user-facing change updates
both; `agent_docs/review-checklist.md` "Docs" and the `docs-parity-reviewer`
subagent enforce the parity before merge.

Do not add placeholder template files for new capabilities. Start from the
existing `CodeMode` package shape, then delete what the new capability does not
need.

## Testing patterns

- Use `pydantic_ai.models.TestModel` for all tests (no real API calls)
- `ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False` is set globally in `conftest.py`
- Tests use `pytest-anyio` for async support
- Each capability test class follows: `TestCapabilityName` with methods `test_<scenario>`
- Prefer tests through `Agent(..., capabilities=[...])` when that is the public
  behavior. Use direct `Toolset`/`RunContext` tests for lower-level lifecycle,
  schema, retry, or wrapper behavior that is hard to isolate through `Agent`.
- Don't import private (`_`-prefixed) helpers into tests. Exercise them through
  the capability's public surface so tests survive internal refactors: drive the
  behavior through `Agent(..., capabilities=[...])`, or import the public class
  re-exported from the capability package's `__init__.py` (e.g.
  `from pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem import FileSystemToolset`, not
  `from pydantic_ai_harness.filesystem._toolset import _content_hash`). When a
  branch is only reachable by calling a private helper directly, mark it
  `# pragma: no cover` rather than reaching into the helper from a test.

## Contributing rules for AICAs

- Never change `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` -- if a dependency is needed, open an issue
- Always link sources for any claims made during research
- Run `make lint && make typecheck && make test` before every commit
- Commit messages should summarize the "why", not the "what"
