**The batteries for your [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) agent.**

---

Pydantic AI's [capabilities](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/) and [hooks](https://ai.pydantic.dev/hooks/) API is how you give an agent its harness -- bundles of tools, lifecycle hooks, instructions, and model settings that extend what the agent can do without any framework changes.

**Pydantic AI Harness** is the official capability library for Pydantic AI, maintained by the [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai) team. Pydantic AI core ships capabilities that require model or framework support, and capabilities fundamental to every agent -- [web search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#provider-adaptive-tools), [tool search](https://ai.pydantic.dev/deferred-tools/), [thinking](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#thinking). Everything else lives here: standalone building blocks you pick and choose to turn your agent into a coding agent, a research assistant, or anything else. This is also where new capabilities start -- as they stabilize and prove themselves broadly essential, they can graduate into core.

## Installation

```bash
uv add pydantic-ai-harness
```

Extras for specific capabilities:

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[codemode]"          # CodeMode (adds the Monty sandbox)
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[dynamic-workflow]"  # DynamicWorkflow (adds the Monty sandbox)
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[logfire]"           # ManagedPrompt (Logfire-managed prompts)
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[exa]"               # ExaSearch + ExaAgent (web research via the Exa API)
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[acp]"               # ACP (serve an agent to editors over the Agent Client Protocol)
```

The `code-mode` extra is also supported as an alias.

Requires Python 3.10+ and `pydantic-ai-slim>=2.14.1`.

## Quick start

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-slim[anthropic,mcp,duckduckgo,logfire]" "pydantic-ai-harness[code-mode]"
```

```python
import logfire
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.capabilities import MCP, WebSearch
from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

# See https://ai.pydantic.dev/logfire/ for setup details.

        # (https://github.com/pydantic/monty -- pulled in by the [code-mode] extra).
        # The model writes Python that calls multiple tools with loops, conditionals,
        # asyncio.gather, and local filtering -- one model round-trip for N tool calls.
        CodeMode(),
        # Connect to any MCP server -- here, the open-source Hacker News server
        # (https://github.com/cyanheads/hn-mcp-server). native=False forces the
        # local MCP toolset so CodeMode can wrap the tools; without it,
        # providers that natively support MCP server connectors execute the tools
        # server-side and bypass the sandbox.
        MCP('https://hn.caseyjhand.com/mcp', native=False),
        # Provider-adaptive web search; native=False routes through the local
        # DuckDuckGo fallback (the [duckduckgo] extra above) so CodeMode can batch
        # web searches alongside the HN calls in a single run_code.
        WebSearch(native=False),
    ],
)

result = agent.run_sync(
    "Across the top, best, and 'show HN' Hacker News feeds, find the most-discussed "
    "story with at least 100 points. Pull its comment thread, its submitter's profile, "
    "and any web coverage. Summarize what you find in one paragraph."
)
print(result.output)
"""
The most-discussed HN story across top/best/show clearing 100 points is "Vibe coding
and agentic engineering are getting closer than I'd like" by Simon Willison (748 points,
853 comments, on the Best feed), submitted by long-time HNer e12e. The piece argues
that the two modes Willison once kept mentally separate -- throwaway "vibe coding" and
disciplined "agentic engineering" -- are blurring, since agents like Claude Code now
reliably handle non-trivial tasks like "build a JSON API endpoint that runs a SQL query"
with tests and docs on the first pass. The HN thread is unusually substantive, with
commenters debating whether LLMs created or merely *exposed* sloppy engineering
practices and warning of a "normalization of deviance" as engineers stop reviewing diffs.

**[See this run as a public Logfire trace ->](https://logfire-us.pydantic.dev/public-trace/84bcf123-2106-49da-9f6f-5c26395339bb?spanId=7650806a0785b946)** Each `run_code` span fans out into the tool calls the model issued from inside the sandbox -- it's the easiest way to understand what code mode actually did.

## Orchestrating sub-agents: DynamicWorkflow

`CodeMode` gives the model one script for its *tools*. `DynamicWorkflow` does the same for *sub-agents*. Without it, an orchestrator delegates one tool call at a time: call a sub-agent, wait, read the result into context, think, call the next one. Ten delegations cost ten model round-trips, and every intermediate result flows through the orchestrator's context whether it needed to see it or not.

With it, the model writes one Python script in which each sub-agent is an async function, and the whole tree runs in a single tool call:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.dynamic_workflow import DynamicWorkflow

reviewer = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', name='reviewer', description='Reviews code for bugs.')
summarizer = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', name='summarizer', description='Summarizes findings.')

orchestrator = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-opus-4-7',
    capabilities=[DynamicWorkflow(agents=[reviewer, summarizer])],
)
```

The script the model writes looks like this -- fan out, chain, and only the last line's value returns to its context:

```python
import asyncio

reports = await asyncio.gather(
    reviewer(task="Review auth.py for bugs:\n<file contents>"),
    reviewer(task="Review parser.py for bugs:\n<file contents>"),
)
await summarizer(task="Summarize these findings:\n" + "\n\n".join(reports))
```

It composes with the rest of the harness:

- **Budgets**: `max_agent_calls` is an exact, host-enforced ceiling on sub-agent runs (it holds even under concurrent fan-out), and by default the whole tree's token spend lands on the parent run's `usage`.
- **On-demand**: `defer_loading=True` keeps the catalog out of the prompt until the model loads the capability, and `reveal()` adds a sub-agent mid-run without disturbing the prompt cache.

`DynamicWorkflow`'s API is subject to change while planned extensions (structured sub-agent inputs, durable workflows) settle the call contract. Breaking changes ship deprecation warnings where practical.

## An ecosystem agent

The Quick start above is deliberately small. Here's the other end of the spectrum -- an agent wired up with capabilities drawn from across the Pydantic AI ecosystem: this repo, core `pydantic-ai`, and the community packages we vouch for in the matrix above.

This snippet is illustrative, not literally copy-pasteable: a few capabilities have setup requirements (a `./skills` directory, a Postgres database for `TodoCapability`'s persistent storage), and the community packages move independently of this one. The [capability matrix](#capability-matrix) tracks each one's status. As the harness ships first-party versions, the imports above will collapse onto fewer packages -- but the example will keep working, since the API surface is the same.

## Help us prioritize

**Vote on whatever is linked in the Status column above.** If there's a PR, vote on the PR -- it means we're actively building it. If there's only an issue, vote on the issue.

Want something that's not on the list? [Open a capability request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new?template=capability-request.yml).

## Build your own

[Capabilities](https://ai.pydantic.dev/capabilities/#building-custom-capabilities) are the primary extension point for Pydantic AI. Any of the existing capabilities in this repo can serve as a reference for building your own.

**Publishing as a standalone package?** Use the `pydantic-ai-<name>` naming convention. See [Publishing capability packages](https://ai.pydantic.dev/extensibility/#publishing-capability-packages).

## Contributing

We welcome capability contributions. Here's how:

1. **Start with an issue.** [Open a capability request](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new?template=capability-request.yml) describing the behavior you want. This lets us discuss the approach and priority before code is written -- we can close an approach without closing the problem.
2. **Then open a PR.** Once the issue exists, you're welcome to open a PR with an implementation. Link the issue in your PR. We review based on community interest -- upvotes on both the issue and PR count.
3. **Don't chase green CI.** Get the approach working, then let us know. We'll take it from there -- we may push to your branch, rewrite, or open a follow-up PR. You'll be credited as the original author. (See the [Pydantic AI contributing guide](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).)

> **Note**: PRs that modify `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` from non-team members are auto-closed by CI to prevent supply chain risk. If you need a new dependency, [open an issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai-harness/issues/new).

## Version policy

Pydantic AI Harness uses **0.x versioning** to signal that APIs are still stabilizing. During 0.x:

- **Minor releases** (0.1 -> 0.2) may include breaking changes -- renamed parameters, changed defaults, restructured APIs. As the library grows, especially as capabilities gain provider-native support (starting as a local implementation, then auto-switching to the provider's built-in API when available), we may need to reshape APIs we couldn't fully anticipate in the initial design.
- **Patch releases** (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1) will not intentionally break existing behavior.
- **All breaking changes** are documented in release notes with migration guidance.
- Where practical, we'll keep the previous behavior available under a deprecated name or configuration option before removing it.

This is why Pydantic AI Harness is a separate package from [Pydantic AI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), which has a [stricter version policy](https://ai.pydantic.dev/version-policy/). As the core capabilities stabilize, we'll move toward 1.0 with stability guarantees to match.
