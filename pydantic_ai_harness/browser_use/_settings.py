"""Typed passthrough for the browser-use `Agent` constructor options.

`BrowserAgentSettings` mirrors the user-facing options of `browser_use.Agent`
(v0.13.x) with browser-use's own defaults, so the whole surface is configurable
on the capability without writing a custom factory. Options the capability
already owns as first-class fields (task, llm, session, vision, output schema,
sensitive data, system-message extension, signal handling) are deliberately not
repeated here.
