"""Typed passthrough for the browser-use `Agent` constructor options.

`BrowserAgentSettings` mirrors the plain-value options of `browser_use.Agent`
(v0.13.x) with browser-use's own defaults, so the whole configurable surface is
reachable from the capability without writing a custom factory. Three groups are
deliberately absent: options the capability already owns as first-class fields
(task, llm, session, vision, output schema, sensitive data, system-message
extension, signal handling), options that are objects the caller has to build in
code (browser-use's callbacks, `injected_agent_state`, `skill_service` -- these
belong in a `BrowserAgentFactory`), and options the toolset controls or that are
not user-facing (`browser`, `browser_profile`, the deprecated `controller` alias
of `tools`, per-run identity like `task_id` and `source`, and private ones).
