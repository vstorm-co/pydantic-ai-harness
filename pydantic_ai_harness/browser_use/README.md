# Browser Use

Delegate open-ended web tasks to an autonomous
[browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) agent. The capability
adds one tool, `browse_web`: the host agent hands over a self-contained
natural-language goal, browser-use drives a real Chromium with its own
perception-action loop (indexed DOM, screenshots, planning, self-healing), and
the tool returns a text result.

## Installation

```bash
uv add "pydantic-ai-harness[browser-use]"
```

The extra needs Python 3.11+ (browser-use's floor; the rest of the harness
supports 3.10). browser-use talks to Chromium directly over CDP and downloads
a browser on first run when none is found locally.

## The problem

Low-level browser tools (goto, click a selector, extract text) work well when
the flow is known: the host model decides every action, which is cheap and
deterministic. On an unknown page layout or a fuzzy goal ("find the price of
the Pro plan", "fill in this form"), the host model ends up micro-managing a
DOM it cannot perceive well, burning a model round-trip per click and getting
stuck on dynamic pages.

## The solution

browser-use already ships an agent tuned for exactly that loop: it indexes the
live DOM into numbered elements, feeds the model page state (optionally with
screenshots), plans, detects loops, and recovers from failed actions.
`BrowserUse` integrates it the way the harness integrates other agents (see
`ExaAgent` and `Subagents`): as a delegation target, not as a bag of low-level
tools. The host agent stays high-level and calls `browse_web` with a goal; the
sub-agent does the browsing and reports back.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse

agent = Agent(
    'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    capabilities=[
        BrowserUse(
            llm='anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
            allowed_domains=['example.com'],
        )
    ],
)

result = agent.run_sync('Check example.com and tell me the price of the Pro plan.')
print(result.output)
```

Each `browse_web` call runs the sub-agent's loop to completion in a browser
session. The tool result is the sub-agent's final text; when the sub-agent
stops without finishing (step budget exhausted, repeated failures) or judges
its own result incomplete, the tool says so instead of presenting a partial
answer as a clean one.

## The sub-agent's model

Pass the sub-agent's model as a Pydantic AI model or model name string -- the
same configuration your host agent uses. The capability wraps it in
`PydanticAIChatModel`, an implementation of browser-use's chat-model protocol
on top of a Pydantic AI model. That buys three things:

- **one provider setup** for host and sub-agent (keys, gateways, base URLs);
- **structured output via Pydantic AI's tool calling**, with validation
  retries -- browser-use's own forced `response_format` schema is rejected by
  some providers (e.g. Anthropic models behind OpenRouter);
- **observability**: sub-agent LLM calls appear in Logfire when
  `logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()` is active.

browser-use's own model wrappers (`ChatAnthropic`, `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatGoogle`,
...) are also accepted and used as-is.

With `llm=None`, browser-use falls back to its own default model selection,
which ends at its hosted `ChatBrowserUse` model. That is a separate account and
API key (`BROWSER_USE_API_KEY`), billed by browser-use, and invisible to your
own model observability. Pass an explicit `llm` to keep inference in your own
stack.

Two cost knobs to know about:

- `use_vision` (default `True`) sends a screenshot with every step, which
  makes the sub-agent markedly better on visual layouts but adds image tokens
  on each of its model calls. Use `'auto'` to follow the model's declared
  vision support, or `False` for text-heavy tasks on a budget.
- browser-use runs a **judge** model call at the end of each task by default,
  evaluating the result. Disable it with
  `BrowserAgentSettings(use_judge=False)` if that extra call matters.

## Agent settings

Everything else `browser_use.Agent` takes is available through
`agent_settings`, a typed mirror of its constructor options with browser-use's
own defaults: judge, planning, timeouts, failure budgets, thinking and flash
modes, screenshot sizing, custom action registries (`tools`), initial actions,
GIF recording, and the rest.

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserAgentSettings, BrowserUse

BrowserUse(
    llm='anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
    agent_settings=BrowserAgentSettings(
        use_judge=False,  # skip the extra judge call per task
        step_timeout=60,
        flash_mode=True,
    ),
)
```

The `*_llm` fields (`judge_llm`, `page_extraction_llm`, `fallback_llm`) accept
the same inputs as `llm`. See `BrowserAgentSettings` for the full list.

## Structured output

Set `output_schema` to a Pydantic model class and the sub-agent is asked to
produce its final result in that shape (browser-use's `output_model_schema`).
The tool then returns the validated result as JSON; a final result that does
not parse surfaces to the host model as a retry prompt instead of malformed
output:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse


class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price_usd: float


BrowserUse(output_schema=Product)
```

## Secrets

`sensitive_data` lets the sub-agent type credentials without its model ever
seeing the values: the model is shown only placeholder keys and writes
`<secret>key</secret>`, and browser-use substitutes the real value in the
browser. Scope entries to a domain with the nested form, and combine with
`allowed_domains` so the values cannot be typed anywhere else:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse

BrowserUse(
    allowed_domains=['travel.example.com'],
    sensitive_data={'https://travel.example.com': {'x_user': 'me@example.com', 'x_pass': '...'}},
)
```

## Sessions and safety

- **One session per call** by default; it is killed in a `finally`, so an
  exception or a cancelled run does not leak a browser process. See
  [Session reuse](#session-reuse) for the shared alternative.
- **Domain allowlist.** `allowed_domains` is enforced by browser-use's
  `BrowserProfile`: navigation outside the list is blocked inside the
  sub-agent, not just discouraged in the prompt. Glob patterns like
  `'*.example.com'` work.
- **Full browser control.** `browser_profile` accepts a complete browser-use
  `BrowserProfile` for everything the convenience fields do not cover: proxy,
  a persistent `user_data_dir` (staying logged in across calls),
  `storage_state` cookies, viewport size, `prohibited_domains`, a specific
  Chromium binary, and so on. The capability's `headless`, `allowed_domains`,
  and `cdp_url` override the profile when set, exactly like directly passed
  fields on a hand-built `BrowserSession`.
- **Step budget.** `max_steps` (default 50) caps the sub-agent's loop; each
  step is one of its model calls. On hitting the cap the tool reports that the
  agent stopped without a result.
- **Sub-agent instructions.** `extend_system_message` appends standing
  constraints to the browser agent's own system prompt ("never submit forms",
  "prefer the English version of pages").
- **Remote browsers.** `cdp_url` attaches the session to an existing Chromium
  (a container, a hosted browser service) instead of launching one locally.
- **Telemetry.** browser-use collects anonymized telemetry by default; set
  `ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=false` to disable it.

## Session reuse

`session_scope` controls how long a browser lives:

- `'call'` (the default): every `browse_web` call gets a fresh session, killed
  when the call ends. Nothing can leak, but nothing carries over either.
- `'agent'`: one session is kept alive and reused across calls -- tabs,
  logins, and page state carry over, and calls are serialized on the shared
  browser. Close it with `aclose()`, or use the capability as an async context
  manager:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse


async def main():
    async with BrowserUse(llm='anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', session_scope='agent') as browser:
        agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[browser])
        first = await agent.run('Log in to app.example.com with the stored credentials.')
        await agent.run('Now open the latest report.', message_history=first.all_messages())
```

A run that fails in `'agent'` scope kills the shared session (its state is
unknown) and the next call starts fresh. For cookie and login persistence
alone -- without keeping a browser process alive -- a `browser_profile` with a
`user_data_dir` also works in `'call'` scope.

## Instructions

The capability contributes short delegation guidance to the system prompt:
hand `browse_web` one self-contained goal in natural language, and prefer it
when the page layout is unknown or the task needs judgement. Set `guidance` to
replace the text, or to `''` to contribute no instructions at all. (`guidance`
steers the *host* model; `extend_system_message` steers the *sub-agent*.)

## Configuration

Every field of `BrowserUse` with its default:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse

BrowserUse(
    llm=None,                    # Pydantic AI model/string or browser-use chat model; None = browser-use's default
    browser_profile=None,        # full BrowserProfile (proxy, user_data_dir, storage_state, ...)
    allowed_domains=None,        # navigation allowlist; None = unrestricted; overrides the profile
    headless=None,               # None = headless, unless a browser_profile decides otherwise
    max_steps=50,                # cap on sub-agent steps per call (one LLM call each)
    use_vision=True,             # send screenshots; 'auto' follows the model, False disables
    output_schema=None,          # Pydantic model class for a structured, validated result
    sensitive_data=None,         # secrets typed by the browser, never shown to the model
    extend_system_message=None,  # extra standing instructions for the sub-agent
    agent_settings=None,         # BrowserAgentSettings: every remaining browser_use.Agent option
    session_scope='call',        # 'call' = fresh browser per call; 'agent' = one shared session
    cdp_url=None,                # attach to a remote Chromium over CDP; overrides the profile
    guidance=None,               # host-model instructions: None = default, '' = none, str = custom
    browser_agent=None,          # BrowserAgentFactory; None builds a real browser_use.Agent
)
```

## Custom agent factory

For the corners neither the fields nor `agent_settings` cover (browser-use
callbacks, skills, injected agent state) -- or to substitute a fake in tests so
nothing launches a browser -- the `browser_agent` field accepts a
`BrowserAgentFactory`. It receives a `BrowserTask` with everything the tool
prepared for the call, including the resolved `settings`, and returns the
agent to run:

```python
from browser_use import Agent as BrowserUseAgent

from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserAgent, BrowserTask, BrowserUse


def factory(request: BrowserTask) -> BrowserAgent:
    return BrowserUseAgent(
        task=request.task,
        llm=request.llm,
        browser_session=request.browser_session,
        use_vision=request.use_vision,
        output_model_schema=request.output_schema,
        sensitive_data=request.sensitive_data,
        extend_system_message=request.extend_system_message,
        enable_signal_handler=False,
        use_judge=request.settings.use_judge,
        skill_ids=['*'],
    )


BrowserUse(browser_agent=factory)
```

`BrowserTask` is a dataclass so new fields can be added without breaking
existing factories: unpack what you forward, ignore the rest (the default
factory, `default_browser_agent`, forwards all of `settings`). The factory
must not start or stop the session itself; the tool owns the session
lifecycle.

## BrowserUse vs scripted browser tools

The two approaches complement each other rather than compete:

| | Scripted tools (Playwright-style) | `BrowserUse` |
|---|---|---|
| Who decides each action | the host model | the browser-use sub-agent |
| Page addressing | CSS selectors / coordinates | indexed DOM elements |
| Cost profile | one host-model call per action | one sub-agent call per step, plus the delegation |
| Determinism | high | lower; self-healing LLM loop |
| Best for | known, repeatable flows | fuzzy goals on unknown or changing pages |

If your flow is fully known, scripted tools are cheaper and more predictable.
Reach for `BrowserUse` when the task needs judgement about pages you have not
seen.

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

`BrowserUse` works with Pydantic AI's
[agent spec](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agent-spec/):

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - BrowserUse:
      allowed_domains: [example.com]
      max_steps: 30
      session_scope: agent
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[BrowserUse])
```

The `llm`, `browser_profile`, `output_schema`, `agent_settings`, and
`browser_agent` fields are not spec-serializable; spec-loaded instances use
browser-use's own default model selection and browser and agent configuration,
prose output, and the default agent factory.

The API may change between releases while the capability settles; breaking
changes ship deprecation warnings where practical.
