    """Delegation of open-ended web tasks to an autonomous [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) agent.

    Adds one tool, `browse_web`, which hands a self-contained natural-language
    goal to a browser-use `Agent`. That agent drives a real Chromium over CDP
    with its own perception-action loop (indexed DOM, screenshots, planning,
    self-healing) and returns a text result; the browser session is killed when
    the run ends, on success or failure.

    ```python
    from browser_use import ChatAnthropic
    from pydantic_ai import Agent

    from pydantic_ai_harness.browser_use import BrowserUse

    agent = Agent(
        'anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6',
        capabilities=[BrowserUse(llm=ChatAnthropic(model='claude-sonnet-4-6'))],
    )
    ```

    Each `browse_web` call launches (or attaches to, with `cdp_url`) a browser
    and runs the sub-agent's loop to completion, so calls are long and cost one
    LLM call per step. The host model is told to reach for it when a task needs
    judgement about unknown pages, not for scripted flows.
