Give an agent a structured, self-updating task list -- without ever invalidating the prompt cache. Optionally persist it, break steps into subtasks with dependencies, and react to changes through events.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability incorporates the task-list features of the standalone [`pydantic-ai-todo`](https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-ai-todo) library -- persistent stores, subtasks, dependencies, and events -- which it supersedes. If you are migrating from `pydantic-ai-todo`, the tools are renamed (`write_todos` -> `write_plan`, `read_todos` -> `read_plan`, `add_todo` -> `add_task`, `update_todo_status(es)` -> `update_task_status(es)`, `remove_todo` -> `remove_task`; subtask tools keep their names).

## The problem

Long agentic runs drift: the model loses track of what it set out to do and what's left. The usual fix -- keep a running plan and re-inject it into the system prompt each turn -- invalidates the prompt cache. The system prompt sits at the front of the request, so every plan edit changes the cached prefix and forces the whole conversation to be re-processed at full token price.

## The solution

`Planning` gives the model a small toolset that owns the plan. The current plan is surfaced back to the model as an *ephemeral* reminder appended to the tail of each request, behind a cache breakpoint:

- The reminder is added after the durable history is persisted, so it reaches the model but is never written to `message_history`. No reminders accumulate across turns.
- A `CachePoint` is placed immediately *before* the reminder, so the cached prefix (tools + system + real conversation) stays byte-identical turn over turn. Only the reminder falls outside the cache.

So the plan stays current in the model's view while the cached prefix is never invalidated; the only added cost is re-reading the reminder each turn.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.planning import Planning

agent = Agent('anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6', capabilities=[Planning()])

result = agent.run_sync('Refactor the auth module and add tests.')
print(result.output)
```

## The tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `write_plan(items)` | Create or replace the full plan (whole-list replacement -- no indices to track). |
| `read_plan()` | Read the current plan with step ids and a progress summary. |
| `add_task(content, active_form)` | Append a single `pending` step. |
| `update_task_status(task_id, status)` | Move one step between statuses by id. |
| `update_task_statuses(updates)` | Apply several status changes atomically (all-or-nothing). |
| `remove_task(task_id)` | Delete a step by id. |

Each step is a `content` string, an optional present-continuous `active_form` label, and a `status` (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`). The convention -- stated in the guidance and the tools' replies -- is to keep exactly one step `in_progress`.

### Subtasks and dependencies

Pass `enable_subtasks=True` to add three more tools and the `blocked` status:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `add_subtask(parent_id, content, active_form)` | Add a child step under a parent. |
| `set_dependency(task_id, depends_on_id)` | Make one step wait for another; the dependent step is auto-`blocked` until its prerequisite completes. Self-dependencies, cycles, and duplicates are rejected. |
| `get_available_tasks()` | List steps with no incomplete dependencies -- the ones that can start now. |

## Persistence

By default the plan lives in memory for the duration of a single run (a fresh, isolated plan per run via `for_run`). Pass a `store` to persist it, or a `store_resolver` to pick one per run:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.planning import Planning, SqlitePlanStore

agent_store = SqlitePlanStore('plan.db', session='user-123')
planning = Planning(store=agent_store)
```

Built-in stores: `InMemoryPlanStore` (default), `SqlitePlanStore` (local file, session-scoped), `PostgresPlanStore` (server database over a caller-owned asyncpg pool), and `RedisPlanStore` (over a caller-owned `redis.asyncio` client). The Postgres and Redis stores take a client you already own, so the harness carries no database driver dependency. Any object implementing the `PlanStore` protocol works.

## Events

Give a store a `PlanEventEmitter` to react to changes -- surface progress in a UI, mirror steps to a tracker, notify a channel on completion:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.planning import InMemoryPlanStore, PlanEventEmitter

emitter = PlanEventEmitter()

@emitter.on_completed
async def announce(event):
    print('done:', event.item.content)

store = InMemoryPlanStore(event_emitter=emitter)
```

Emitted types: `created`, `updated`, `status_changed`, `completed`, `deleted`.

Events come from the granular tools (`add_task`, `update_task_status`, `add_subtask`, ...). `write_plan` is a bulk whole-plan replacement and is **event-silent**, so a UI driven purely off events won't see plans the model builds or rewrites with `write_plan`. Read the plan after the run too, or steer the model toward the granular tools when you need live event coverage.

## Why whole-plan replacement

Addressing steps by mutable integer index (insert/remove/reorder) is error-prone for both the code and the model. `write_plan` restates the whole plan each call, so there are no indices to track. Granular edits (`add_task`, `update_task_status`, `remove_task`) instead reference the stable `id` shown by `read_plan`.

## Caching guarantee

The plan is never injected into the system prompt or instructions. Static usage guidance goes there (cache-stable); only the mutable plan rides the ephemeral tail reminder. Set `inject=False` to disable the reminder entirely. `CachePoint` is supported on Anthropic and Amazon Bedrock; on providers without prompt caching it's simply ignored.

## Configuration

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.planning import Planning

Planning(
    guidance=None,           # static system-prompt guidance; None = default, '' = omit
    cache_ttl='5m',          # TTL for the cache breakpoint before the reminder ('5m' | '1h')
    store=None,              # None = fresh in-memory plan per run; or a PlanStore to persist
    enable_subtasks=False,   # add subtask/dependency tools and the 'blocked' status
    inject=True,             # surface the current plan as a cache-safe tail reminder
    descriptions=None,       # optional per-tool description overrides, keyed by tool name
)
```

## Agent spec (YAML/JSON)

`Planning` works with Pydantic AI's [agent spec](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agent-spec/):

```yaml
# agent.yaml
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
capabilities:
  - Planning: {}
```

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.planning import Planning

agent = Agent.from_file('agent.yaml', custom_capability_types=[Planning])
```
