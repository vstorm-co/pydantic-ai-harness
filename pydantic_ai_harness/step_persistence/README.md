`StepPersistence` records what an agent did at each boundary, separate from
whether the run can be safely resumed. It is the persistence substrate for
orchestrators that delegate to sub-agents (e.g. an AICA orchestrator spawning
a `code_librarian` to investigate one symbol, then continuing that delegate's
investigation with a follow-up question).

It is not a full graph-state checkpoint. Capability-state restore, workspace
snapshots, and graph-node resume are out of scope and tracked separately
(see `pydantic-ai-harness` issues #149 and #196).

## What it gives you

1. **Append-only step events** -- every interesting boundary (run start/end,
   model request, tool call, failure) appends a `StepEvent`. A run killed
   mid-tool-call still leaves a usable event trail.
2. **Continuable snapshots** -- a `ContinuableSnapshot` is saved only at
   boundaries where the message history is **provider-valid**: every
   `ToolCallPart` has a matching `ToolReturnPart` or `RetryPromptPart`, with
   no orphan, duplicate, or out-of-order returns. Pass the snapshot's
   `messages` back to `Agent.run(message_history=...)` to continue or fork.
3. **Tool-effect ledger** -- every tool call's lifecycle (`started`,
   `completed`, `failed`) is recorded against `(run_id, tool_call_id)`.
   After a crash, a tool with a `started` record and no terminal update
   should be treated as `unknown_after_crash`: the side effect may or may
   not have happened.
4. **Lineage metadata** -- `conversation_id` (sequence) and `parent_run_id`
   (hierarchy) are independent axes. See [Three-level identity](#three-level-identity).

## Quick start

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import StepPersistence, InMemoryStepStore

store = InMemoryStepStore()
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)

await librarian.run('Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance')
```

That is the whole setup. **`run_id` is always per-`Agent.run` call**,
matching pydantic_ai's `RunContext.run_id`. For multi-turn logical
grouping use `conversation_id=` -- that is the pydantic_ai-native
primitive for it (see [Three-level identity](#three-level-identity)).

`run_id` resolution per call:

- **Explicit `run_id='libr-1'`** becomes the id for this one call.
  Single-shot use cases (deterministic id for testing, replay, debugging,
  a one-off scripted run). Reusing one capability instance with the same
  explicit `run_id` across multiple `.run()` calls raises `ValueError`
  in `before_run` -- the tool-effect ledger is keyed by
  `(run_id, tool_call_id)` and providers reuse deterministic tool-call
  ids, so a silent collision would erase the `unknown_after_crash`
  signal. Use `conversation_id=` for multi-turn grouping instead.
- **`agent_name` set, `run_id` unset** derives `'{agent_name}-{8-char-hex}'`,
  freshly materialised in `for_run` per `.run()` call. Reusing one
  capability instance across runs yields distinct ids
  (`code_librarian-a3b2`, `code_librarian-c9d1`, and so on). This is the
  recommended default for delegate capabilities.
- **Neither set** falls back to `ctx.run_id` (pydantic_ai's auto-generated
  id) per `.run()` call, and to a UUID4 if that is absent.

The orchestrator pattern -- one logical agent serving many turns -- uses
`conversation_id`, not a shared `run_id`:

```python
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)

for turn in turns:
    await orchestrator.run(turn, conversation_id='orch-conv')

# All turns of this orchestrator, chronological:
records = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv')
```

## Three-level identity

The capability mirrors pydantic_ai's identity stack:

| Concept | Definition | Granularity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation_id` | The dialogue. Resolved by pydantic_ai from the `conversation_id=` argument to `Agent.run`, or the most recent `conversation_id` on `message_history`, or a fresh UUID7. | sequence of runs |
| `run_id` | One `Agent.run` invocation. | one step in the sequence |
| `step_index` | Graph-node count *within* a run (`ctx.run_step`). | one node within one run |

`StepEvent.conversation_id` and `RunRecord.conversation_id` are populated
from `ctx.conversation_id`. So three `.run()` calls sharing one
`conversation_id` produce three distinct `run_id`s, all queryable as a
group:

```python
runs = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')  # 3 records, chronological
```

## Continuing a delegate's investigation

pydantic_ai already has `message_history=` for "carry on with this prior
context". `StepPersistence` does not introduce a parallel mechanism -- it
exposes one helper that loads the most recent provider-valid snapshot:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import continue_run

# Earlier: tag the first turn with a conversation id so the follow-up can find it.
await librarian.run(
    'Find ThinkingPartDelta and confirm the callable allowance',
    conversation_id='libr-conv',
)

# Later (possibly a different process):
prior_run = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='libr-conv'))[-1].run_id
history = await continue_run(store, run_id=prior_run)
await librarian.run(
    'Read _apply_provider_details_delta and check the path',
    message_history=history,
    conversation_id='libr-conv',   # keep the conversation grouping
)
```

`fork_run(store, run_id=...)` returns the same shape but is intended when
the caller wants a branched logical run from that snapshot point (the new
run gets a fresh `run_id` and probably a fresh `conversation_id`).

### What "safe to continue from" means

`continue_run` only returns the messages of the latest provider-valid
snapshot for that `run_id`. Snapshots are written at two boundaries:

- after every `CallToolsNode` completes (all tool calls returned), and
- at `after_run`, as a fallback if the run reached no such boundary.

A run that crashed mid-tool-call has events (`tool_call_started`) but no
snapshot for that point. `continue_run` returns the snapshot from the
previous safe boundary, not the failed step. If no continuable snapshot
exists at all, `continue_run` raises `LookupError`.

## Run lineage -- `parent_run_id`

`parent_run_id` is a lineage label, not a functional dependency. It does
two things:

- Every `StepEvent` and `RunRecord` carries it, so you can filter / group.
- `store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-1')` returns every delegate run
  pointing at that orchestrator.

It is auto-inferred for in-process delegation: when an orchestrator's
tool synchronously calls a delegate's `Agent.run(...)`, the delegate's
`StepPersistence` picks up the orchestrator's `run_id` via a `ContextVar`
that the orchestrator's `wrap_run` set. No threading required:

```python
orchestrator = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='orchestrator')],
)
librarian = Agent(
    'openai:gpt-5',
    capabilities=[StepPersistence(store=store, agent_name='code_librarian')],
)

@orchestrator.tool_plain
async def ask_librarian(question: str) -> str:
    result = await librarian.run(question)   # parent_run_id auto-filled
    return result.output

# Tag the orchestrator turn so the lookup below can find its run_id.
await orchestrator.run(
    'Where is ThinkingPartDelta defined?',
    conversation_id='orch-conv',
)

# All librarian runs now point at the orchestrator's run_id:
orch_run_id = (await store.list_runs(conversation_id='orch-conv'))[-1].run_id
delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id=orch_run_id)
```

Set `parent_run_id=` explicitly to override (e.g. cross-process delegation
where `ContextVar`s do not propagate).

`parent_run_id` is distinct from `conversation_id`. The orchestrator
and delegate usually live in *different* conversations (the orchestrator
talks to a user; the delegate talks to itself). But they share a
parent-child link.

## Inspecting a run tree

`list_runs` returns matches sorted by `started_at` ascending across both
backends -- pick the most recent with `[-1]`.

```python
# Every delegate of one orchestrator run (chronological)
delegates = await store.list_runs(parent_run_id='orch-3f2a')

# Every run in one dialogue (multi-turn conversation across many .run() calls)
turns = await store.list_runs(conversation_id='conv-abc')
latest_turn = turns[-1]

# Filters combine (AND):
focused = await store.list_runs(
    parent_run_id='orch-3f2a',
    conversation_id='libr-conv',
)

# Detail per run:
events = await store.list_events(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
snapshot = await store.latest_snapshot(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id=delegates[0].run_id)
```

## Failure recovery

```python
# An earlier delegate run died mid-investigation.
events = await store.list_events(run_id='libr-3f2a')
unresolved = await store.list_unresolved_tool_effects(run_id='libr-3f2a')
for record in unresolved:
    # status == 'started' with no terminal update -- unknown_after_crash.
    print(f'tool {record.tool_name} ({record.tool_call_id}) may or may not have run')
    print(f'  idempotency_key={record.idempotency_key}  '
          f'effect_summary={record.effect_summary}')

# Decide whether to resume or branch:
history = await continue_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
# If the unresolved tools were read-only and safe to redo:
await librarian.run('continue investigating', message_history=history,
                    conversation_id='libr-conv')
# If side effects might have happened and the orchestrator wants a fresh attempt:
history = await fork_run(store, run_id='libr-3f2a')
# ... pass to a new delegate run with a different agent_name / conversation_id.
```

Side-effect deduplication is the orchestrator's responsibility. Tools that
write external state should annotate their in-flight `ToolEffectRecord`
via `annotate_tool_effect`:

```python
from pydantic_ai import RunContext
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import annotate_tool_effect

@orchestrator.tool
async def set_label(ctx: RunContext[Deps], issue: int, label: str) -> str:
    await annotate_tool_effect(
        store,
        ctx,
        idempotency_key=f'issue-{issue}::label::{label}',
        effect_summary=f'set label {label!r} on issue #{issue}',
    )
    await github.set_label(issue, label)   # the actual side effect
    return 'ok'
```

The helper reads the active `run_id` from the `StepPersistence`
`ContextVar` and `tool_call_id` / `tool_name` from `ctx`, then merges the
metadata into the prior record. It is a no-op when called outside a
step-persistence-wrapped tool call. `after_tool_execute` preserves both
fields when it writes the terminal `completed` / `failed` entry.

## Backends

- `InMemoryStepStore` -- process-local; great for tests.
- `FileStepStore(directory)` -- directory layout under `<directory>/<run_id>/`:
    - `run.json` -- `RunRecord` (lineage)
    - `events.jsonl` -- append-only `StepEvent`s
    - `tool_effects.jsonl` -- append-only `ToolEffectRecord`s, scoped to this run
    - `snapshots/{seq}.json` -- `ContinuableSnapshot`s, named by a per-run
      monotonic counter (NOT `step_index`, which would collide when the
      same `run_id` is reused across `Agent.run` calls -- `ctx.run_step`
      resets to 0 each call).
- `SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db')` -- single SQLite file with tables
  `runs`, `events`, `snapshots`, `tool_effects`, and a sibling `media`
  table for externalized blobs (see [Persisting media](#persisting-media)
  below). WAL mode is enabled; `tool_effects` upserts per
  `(run_id, tool_call_id)` so the latest state wins; snapshots use
  `AUTOINCREMENT seq` to mirror `FileStepStore._next_snapshot_seq`.
  Pass `connection=` instead of `database=` to share a `sqlite3.Connection`
  with the rest of your application; the connection must be opened with
  `check_same_thread=False` because hook calls are dispatched onto a
  worker thread.

All three implement the same async `StepStore` protocol, so capability
hooks never block the event loop on the file/sqlite backends (I/O is
dispatched via `anyio.to_thread`).

`FileStepStore` validates `run_id` against `[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{1,200}` (and
rejects `..`) to prevent path traversal -- callers passing user-controlled
IDs should still sanitise first.

## Persisting media

`BinaryContent` payloads (images, audio, documents, video) inline as
base64 inside a snapshot would balloon every file/row containing the
message. Both `FileStepStore` and `SqliteStepStore` externalize any
`BinaryContent.data` at or above 64 KiB through a configured `MediaStore`,
leaving a URI reference in the snapshot. Round-trip is transparent --
`latest_snapshot(...).messages[*]` returns `BinaryContent` with the
original bytes.

| StepStore           | Default `media_store`                  | Where blobs live                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `InMemoryStepStore` | _(not applicable)_                     | bytes stay in the in-memory snapshot  |
| `FileStepStore`     | `DiskMediaStore(<root>/media/)`        | `<root>/media/<sha256>.bin`           |
| `SqliteStepStore`   | `SqliteMediaStore(database=<same db>)` | sibling `media` table in the same DB  |

Override the destination by passing your own `MediaStore`:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.step_persistence import FileStepStore
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore

store = FileStepStore(
    'runs',
    media_store=S3MediaStore(
        bucket='my-bucket',
        endpoint='https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
        region='auto',
        access_key_id=...,
        secret_access_key=...,
    ),
    media_threshold_bytes=64 * 1024,  # raise/lower if you want
)
```

Opt out entirely (keep bytes inline in the snapshot JSON/row):

```python
FileStepStore('runs', media_store=None)
SqliteStepStore(database='runs.db', media_store=None)
```

URIs are `media+sha256://<hex>`, content-addressed. The same blob written
through any `MediaStore` resolves the same way -- dedup is automatic and
moving the underlying storage is a one-line swap. The shipped
implementations are:

- `DiskMediaStore(directory)` -- one file per blob at
  `<directory>/<sha256>.bin`.
- `SqliteMediaStore(database=...)` or `SqliteMediaStore(connection=...)` --
  one row per blob (`INSERT OR IGNORE` for content-addressed dedup).
- `S3MediaStore(bucket=, endpoint=, region=, access_key_id=, secret_access_key=)`
  -- path-style URLs + handrolled SigV4. Compatible with AWS S3, Cloudflare
  R2 (`region='auto'`), MinIO, and other S3-compatible providers. PUT/GET/HEAD
  only -- no multipart, lifecycle, or listing in v1.

### Exposing externalized bytes as URLs

Each store accepts a `public_url=` callable that turns the canonical
`media+sha256://<hex>` URI into a URL the model can fetch directly. The
forthcoming `MediaExternalizer` capability will use this to swap
`BinaryContent` parts for `ImageUrl` / `AudioUrl` / etc. before the
model sees the message -- letting providers fetch big media over the wire
without re-encoding bytes into the request body.

Static base URL (public R2 bucket, CDN):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import S3MediaStore, make_static_public_url

store = S3MediaStore(
    bucket='my-bucket',
    endpoint='https://<acc>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
    region='auto',
    access_key_id=..., secret_access_key=...,
    key_prefix='media/',
    public_url=make_static_public_url('https://pub-abc.r2.dev', key_prefix='media/'),
)
```

Presigned / rotating-signature URL -- pass any async callable that takes
`(uri, MediaContext)`:

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import MediaContext, S3MediaStore

async def presign(uri: str, ctx: MediaContext) -> str:
    key = 'media/' + uri.removeprefix('media+sha256://') + '.bin'
    return await my_signer.generate(key, ttl=3600, content_type=ctx.media_type)

store = S3MediaStore(..., public_url=presign)
```

### `MediaContext`, extensible per-operation bag

Every `MediaStore` method (`put`, `get`, `exists`, `public_url`,
`get_metadata`) and both user-supplied callables (`PublicUrlResolver`,
`KeyStrategy`) accept a `MediaContext`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True)
class MediaContext:
    media_type: str | None = None      # e.g. 'image/png'
    filename: str | None = None        # original filename, when known
    metadata: Mapping[str, str] = {}   # user-supplied tags
```

All fields default; new fields are added non-breakingly as use cases
emerge. Pass what you have, ignore the rest.

**Persistence by store.** `get_metadata(uri)` round-trips the
user-supplied `metadata` mapping on all three stores. `media_type` is
also persisted but is not part of what `get_metadata` returns (it is
stored for the byte payload itself, e.g. as the `Content-Type`).

- `SqliteMediaStore` writes `metadata` to a JSON column and `media_type`
  to a dedicated column
- `S3MediaStore` sends `metadata` as signed `x-amz-meta-*` headers
  (ASCII alphanumeric + dash key names) and `media_type` as
  `Content-Type`; `get_metadata` reads the `x-amz-meta-*` values back
  from the HEAD response
- `DiskMediaStore` writes a sidecar JSON file (`<resolved>.meta.json`)
  alongside each blob, atomic via tmp + rename. Sidecars are absent
  only when the put carried no metadata

### `key_strategy` -- controlling the backend storage path

Default is `<sha256>.bin`. `DiskMediaStore` and `S3MediaStore` accept
overrides to fit existing layouts; `SqliteMediaStore` does not (its
primary key is the digest, so a user-chosen key would either break
dedup or be a no-op):

```python
from pydantic_ai_harness.media import DiskMediaStore, MediaContext

def by_media_type(uri: str, ctx: MediaContext) -> str:
    digest = uri.removeprefix('media+sha256://')
    ext = {'image/png': '.png', 'image/jpeg': '.jpg'}.get(ctx.media_type or '', '.bin')
    return f'images/{digest}{ext}'

store = DiskMediaStore('runs', key_strategy=by_media_type)
```

**Caveat**: if your strategy depends on `context.media_type` (e.g. to
pick an extension), `get(uri)` and `exists(uri)` won't find the blob
unless the same context is supplied at read time. For pure
path-organisation strategies (no context dependency) the constraint
doesn't apply.

`DiskMediaStore` rejects strategies that produce absolute paths or paths
containing `..` segments, to prevent escaping the store directory.

Separately, all three stores accept a `public_url=` resolver, useful
when a CDN, local HTTP server, or signed-URL service fronts the bytes.
Without it `public_url(...)` returns `None` (the model never sees a URL
unless a resolver is configured and it returns a string).

pyai providers transparently download bytes from a URL when the target
model doesn't natively accept that URL type, so emitting a URL is
always safe -- you only ever lose wire savings, never correctness.

> **Note on the future `MediaExternalizer` capability.** When it lands,
> the composition will be
> `Agent(capabilities=[MediaExternalizer(store), StepPersistence(...)])`
> and `StepPersistence` will see already-URL-ified messages -- the
> externalize walk becomes a no-op. The existing API does not change.

### Persisting unsupported backends

DynamoDB, Postgres, Redis, GCS, and other backends are out of scope for
this release. Write your own `StepStore` (about ten methods on a Protocol) or
your own `MediaStore` (three methods) and pass it via `store=` /
`media_store=`. Please open an issue if you ship one -- we want to feed
the eventual shared adapter layer with N >= 3 real implementations before
abstracting.

## What this capability does not do

- It does not restore capability per-run state, graph-node state, retry
  counters, or in-flight streaming responses.
- It does not deduplicate replayed side effects automatically. Tools that
  write artifacts, labels, PRs, or external state should call
  `annotate_tool_effect(store, ctx, ...)` (see [Failure recovery](#failure-recovery))
  so the orchestrator can decide whether replay is safe.
- It does not clean up old snapshots/events. Retention is the caller's
  responsibility.
- It does not emit OpenTelemetry spans. pydantic_ai's `Instrumentation`
  capability already spans `agent run` / `chat` / `running tool` and
  populates `gen_ai.agent.name`, `gen_ai.agent.call.id`,
  `gen_ai.conversation.id` via baggage. A future change may add
  step-persistence attributes to the active span; that is tracked as a
  follow-up issue.
