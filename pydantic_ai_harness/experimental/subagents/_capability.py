@dataclass
class SubAgents(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """Let an agent delegate self-contained tasks to named sub-agents.

    Exposes a single `delegate_task(agent_name, task)` tool. Each delegation
    runs the chosen sub-agent in a fresh, isolated run (it never sees the parent
    conversation), and the available sub-agents are listed in the system prompt
    as a static, cache-stable instruction.

    Sub-agents are passed as a sequence of `SubAgent` entries, each pairing an
    agent with its per-delegate run controls (a `usage_limits` budget, a
    wall-clock `timeout_seconds`, a per-run `max_calls` budget, an `on_failure`
    steering message, and optional `name`/`description` overrides). A delegate's
    name is its `SubAgent.name`, or the agent's own `name` when unset; two
    explicitly-passed delegates resolving to the same name is an error.

    Sub-agents are also loaded from disk by default: each markdown agent definition
    under `./.agents/agents/` and `~/.agents/agents/` (or the `.claude/` equivalent)
    becomes a delegate, built with the parent's model. Disk delegates get no tools
    by default (`inherit_tools` is `False`); set `inherit_tools=True` to expose the
    parent's tools, or pass a `tool_resolver` to map their frontmatter tool names.
    Disk delegates coexist with explicitly-passed ones; explicitly-passed agents take
    precedence, then the project folder, then the home folder. A disk delegate whose
    name is already taken is skipped with a warning. Configure or disable this with
    `agent_folders`; see also `agent_overrides` and `tool_resolver`.

    The parent's `deps` are forwarded to each sub-agent (sub-agents therefore
    share the parent's `AgentDepsT`), and by default the parent's `usage` is
    shared so usage limits apply across the whole agent tree. Optionally, the
    parent's tools can be inherited (`inherit_tools`), extra capabilities can be
    applied to every sub-agent run (`shared_capabilities`), and sub-agent events
    can be streamed to a handler (`event_stream_handler`).
