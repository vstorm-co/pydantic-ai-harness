    """Capability that lets the model orchestrate named sub-agents from a Python script.

    Instead of one sub-agent per tool call, the model writes a single Python script (run in a
    Monty sandbox) that calls each sub-agent as an async function and composes the results: fan
    out with `asyncio.gather`, chain one agent's output into the next, vote, or loop until done.

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness.experimental.dynamic_workflow import DynamicWorkflow

    reviewer = Agent('openai:gpt-5', name='reviewer', description='Review code for bugs.')
    summarizer = Agent('openai:gpt-5', name='summarizer', description='Summarize findings.')

    orchestrator = Agent(
        'openai:gpt-5',
        capabilities=[DynamicWorkflow(agents=[reviewer, summarizer])],
    )
    ```

    Each sub-agent runs isolated (its own message history) with the parent's `deps` forwarded;
    by default the parent's `usage` accumulator is shared so the whole tree's spend is tallied in
    one place. Use `max_agent_calls` for a hard, host-enforced ceiling on sub-agent runs. Workflows
    do not nest. Set `defer_loading=True` (with a stable `id`) to keep the tool out of the prompt
    until the model loads the capability.
